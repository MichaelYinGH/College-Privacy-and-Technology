      <h1>The number of surveillance cameras counted in and around Harvard University</h1>
      <h4>The region comprised Harvard Yard, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Stadium</h4>
      <h4>The counting was conducted in Fall 2021 through Professor Jim Waldo's CS 105: Privacy and Technology</h4>
      <h4>The 726 figure reflects one group's count; some groups spotted fewer cameras, while others counted more</h4>

      <h4>Science Center Plaza Cam 24/7 Livestream</h4>
      <p>Some cameras are maintained by local stores or used solely for security purposes</p>
      <p>Others are much more public, however; for instance, Harvard's Common Spaces YouTube channel maintains a 24/7 livestream of the Science Center Plaza</p>

      <h4>Types of Cameras</h4>
      <p>While some of Harvard's cameras are stereotypically camera-looking, there are many different types of cameras that come in all shapes and sizes</p>
      <p>For instance, this is a picture of a flat eyeball-esque camera in the Harvard athletics facilities</p>

    Harvard's policies on the installation and use of video cameras (which can be found <a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/final_video_camera_policy_may_25_2016.pdf" style="color:blue">here</a>) include:
    <ul>
      <li>Each School or unit at Harvard has at least one person who reviews and approves requests to install video cameras and check their data</li>
      <li>Cameras for security and facilities management purposes can't be installed in dorm rooms, restrooms, locker rooms, classrooms, or offices</li>
      <li>Beyond these University-wide rules, Schools/units can create further restrictions on camera placements</li>
      <li>Exceptions can be made to these rules if there are threats to safety or property</li>
      <li>Unless requested by law enforcement, video cameras cannot record audio or be deliberately concealed; specific notices of camera presence are not required, though</li>
      <li>Camera data can be used for investigations (criminal or legal), crime prevention, maintenance, construction monitoring, or any other "legitimate institutional purpose"</li>
    </ul>
