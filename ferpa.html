      <h2>What is FERPA?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      First signed into law in 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) was created to expand on existing education legislation by better protecting student record confidentiality. The act has since been amended 9 times, most recently in 2011.

      <h2>What FERPA rights do I have?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      FERPA protections for a child’s education records initially go through parents, but these privacy rights transfer to the child when they turn 18 (at which point they become an “eligible student”). In particular, a parent/eligible student may:
      <ul>
        <li>Inspect the student’s education records maintained by their school. The school must comply within 45 days, and cannot charge a fee for doing so (except copying fees).</li>
        <li>Request amendments to the student’s education records if they are inaccurate or misleading. </li>
        <li>Have a formal hearing if the school decides not to accept a requested amendment.</li>
        <li>Place a statement about contested information in the student’s record.</li>
        <li>Decline to allow the school to release information from the student’s record. However, in some cases, like sending information to a school the student is transferring to or complying with a subpoena, the school may still share student records without consent.</li>
        <li>Request that the school not disclose directory information about the student.</li>
      </ul>
      Schools are required to notify parents/eligible students about their rights under FERPA, as well as what directory information they may disclose if no requests to the contrary are made.

      <h2>What happens if my FERPA rights are violated?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      If a parent’s/student’s FERPA rights are violated, they can file a complaint with the Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office (FCPO). The complaints must be timely (typically within 180 days of the violation), but extensions can be requested. If the FCPO decides to investigate and finds a violation, they will lay out steps the school must take and a timeline for compliance. However, the Supreme Court held in 2002 that FERPA violations aren’t eligible to be challenged via private lawsuits.

      <h2>What are the rules for college students?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      Students at post-secondary schools (e.g. college students) are also eligible students under FERPA, but are not allowed to review their parents’ financial records or (perhaps most prominently) letters of recommendation for which they waived their FERPA inspection rights. Schools are also allowed to disclose a post-secondary student’s disciplinary proceeding results to victims of violence or sex offenses, and (if under 21) a post-secondary student’s violation of a law/school rule regarding alcohol or drug use to parents.

      <p>It’s important to note that independent students at post-secondary schools and students over 18 have essentially full control over their student records, and parents can be either authorized to access or barred from accessing particular information. However, if a parent claims the student as a dependent for tax purposes, they can still formally request student records.</p>
