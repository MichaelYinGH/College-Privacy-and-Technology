    <li>This policy applies across all parts of Harvard University, including Harvard College</li>
    <li>The University cannot routinely monitor your personal data, can only access it for specific purposes, and must limit its scope of access and who has access to user electronic information as much as possible</li>
    <li>Access to the data of Harvard College students is authorized by the College Dean or the dean's designee</li>
    <li>The process follows the general form below although there are exceptions in the case of litigation and safety related requests</li>
