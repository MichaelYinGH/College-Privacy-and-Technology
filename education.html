  <h1>An overview of privacy concerns present in several common online education tools</h1>
  <h3>Especially after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, college courses rely heavily on online education tools for lecturing, giving assignments, reviewing tests, and more. Given the large number of virtual student-faculty interactions, we wanted to offer some insight into potential student privacy concerns for some commonly used tools.</h2>

      <p>Canvas provides detailed analytics about each student’s activities on a course website. Although these analytics can be made available to students, this is frequently disabled by instructors so that only instructors can see them. Although some analytics are straightforward metrics like a student’s grade in the class, instructors can also see exactly when a student views a file or Canvas page. <a style="color:blue" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-analytics-for-a-student-in-a-course/ta-p/969">1</a></p>
      <p>For quizzes created on Canvas, instructors also get a detailed quiz log for each student’s quiz attempts. This includes not only students’ final answers, but also exactly when they viewed/answered each question, and any instances in which students stop viewing the Canvas quiz page. Canvas states in its instructor guide, “Quiz logs should not be used to validate academic integrity or identify occurrences of cheating,” but they have no safeguards in place to ensure this. <a style="color:blue" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-quiz-log-for-a-student/ta-p/580">2</a></p>

      <p>Fortunately, private messages between meeting participants don’t appear on the meeting’s saved chat transcript, despite rumors to the contrary. However, Zoom does provide users with a dashboard of statistics about their meetings that may be used by instructors. For instance, meeting and webinar participants’ device types, locations, network types, and join and leave times are visible, and may be exported to a CSV file. <a style="color:blue" href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360039017432-Dashboard-for-meetings-and-webinars">3</a></p>

      <p>Blackboard Collaborate generates session reports that show when participants joined and left each session, as well as each participant’s response for poll questions. <a style="color:blue" href="https://help.blackboard.com/Collaborate/Ultra/Moderator/Reports">4</a></p>

      <p>Each time a user goes to the next page in a Qualtrics survey, their previous answers are saved by Qualtrics. The survey creator can choose what to do with these “responses in progress”: they may be kept incomplete for as little as an hour and as long as a year, at which point they may either be deleted or recorded for the creator to use as they see fit. <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/partial-completion/">5</a></p>

      <p>Proctorio’s entire use case is potentially privacy invasive. To ensure exam security, their Online Proctoring tool records a user’s video and audio, their screen, and even their web traffic to generate a suspicion score for exam administrators. Functions like opening new tabs or right clicking can also be disabled. <a style="color:blue" href="https://proctorio.com/products/online-proctoring">6</a></p>

  <div class="row w3-content w3-padding" style="max-width:1364px">
    <p>These privacy concerns are not universal among all education tools. For instance, to the frustration of some instructors, gather.town does not provide an automated way to collect attendance, and Google Forms does not make autosaved response drafts available to form creators.</p>
