    <div class="column right">
      <p><b>What if somebody seized or stole your laptop?</b> It is possible, although unlikely, that your laptop could be seized and searched when passing through security while traveling, entering a venue, etc. To prevent individuals from accessing your data without your consent, you can quickly and easily encrypt your hard drive that will only unlock if you enter a password.
      <br><em>For a macOS laptop</em>: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → FileVault → Turn on FileVault if it’s not automatically enabled.
      <br><em>For a Windows laptop:</em> Start button > Settings > Update & Security > Device encryption. If there is no “Device Encryption” option, click “Manage Bitlocker” and turn the feature on.</p><br></div>

      <p><b>Are you worried about viruses other than the coronavirus?</b> You should be! Antivirus software defends against computer viruses, ransomware, and Trojan horse programs, all of which can be easily encountered while casually browsing the internet. Harvard Internet Security recommends using either <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html">BitDefender Antivirus Free</a> or <a href="https://www.avast.com/en-us/free-antivirus-download">Avast Free Antivirus</a>.

    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      <p><b>Do you use the same password across dozens of sites?</b> Ideally, all of your passwords should be distinct and somewhat complex. Instead of attempting to remember each of your passwords, use a single secure password vault instead. Lastpass offers very convenient and easy to use options such as autofilling username and password at most sites. Free Lastpass Premium for Harvard affiliates can be <a href="https://security.harvard.edu/lastpass">found here</a> and general free Lastpass Premium for students can be <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/solutions/education">found here</a>.</p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-user-lock"></i> (4) Turn on 2-factor authentication for your most protected accounts</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      <p>Your most important accounts, such as your bank account or your password vault, should be under extra protection in addition to the password stored in your password vault detailed above. There are three main types of authentication: something you know (typically a password), something you have (usually your phone), and something you are (biometrics such as your fingerprint). If you navigate to the privacy settings of most accounts, there is often an option to add a “something you have” authentication using Duo mobile or other methods. Adding this option makes it less likely that individuals can access your account in the case of a password leak.</p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-wifi"></i> (5) Get a VPN and use it on less secure networks</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      <p>Public wifi, such as WiFi at a coffee shop, is less secure than private wifi. To better secure your privacy, use a VPN, which extends a private network across a public network. Harvard offers the use of Cisco AnyConnect Secure to anyone with a HarvardKey.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> (6) Set up Mobile Pay and use it as much as possible</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      <p>Mobile pay methods, such as Apple Pay, are often both more convenient and more secure. Instead of sending over your full credit card information, as you do with your physical credit or debit card, mobile pay methods generate a one-time authentication code for each transaction, making it impossible for someone to re-use that information to conduct another transaction. Setting up mobile pay usually only involves scanning your credit card and takes less than a minute. In addition, after initially entering in your credit card information, your smartphone does not keep your full credit card information stored on your device.
        <br><b>On an iPhone:</b> open the Wallet app, tap the add button, and follow the instructions to enter your credit card information (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204506">Instructions</a>).
        <br><b>On an Android:</b> Open the Google Pay app, tap Menu on the top left, select Payment methods, select Enable contactless, and then follow the instructions to verify your payment method (<a href="https:support.google.com/pay/answer/7644134?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">Instructions</a>).

    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      <p>Information such as passwords, IP addresses, and other private information is often exposed through leaks over the years. Many people share passwords between accounts and can easily leak passwords for multiple accounts in one leak, so be sure to take a look to see if your information was leaked!</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column right">
      <p>Google, Bing, and other search engines collect your previous searches, what results you click on, etc. and link that data to your IP address and account in order to advertise specifically to you. This information collection can be prevented by using a privacy conscious search engine such as DuckDuckGo, which records anonymized search history but does not retain your IP address or other identifying information.
        <br>To change your default search history on Google Chrome: Click on the three vertical dots in top right corner, by your Chrome extensions → Settings → Search Engine → Change dropdown from Google to DuckDuckGo</p>
